name: 'RegionInstanceGroupManager'
kind: 'compute#instanceGroupManager'
description: |
	Creates a managed instance group using the information that you specify in
the request. After the group is created, it schedules an action to create
instances in the group using the specified instance template. This
operation is marked as DONE when the group is created even if the
instances in the group have not yet been created. You must separately
verify the status of the individual instances.

A managed instance group can have up to 1000 VM instances per group.
