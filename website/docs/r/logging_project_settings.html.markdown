# google\_logging\_project\_settings

Default resource settings control whether CMEK is required for new log buckets. These settings also determine the storage location for the _Default and _Required log buckets, and whether the _Default sink is enabled or disabled.


To get more information about ProjectSettings, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/TopLevel/getSettings)
* How-to Guides
    * [Configure default settings for organizations and folders](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/default-settings)

## Example Usage - Logging Project Settings All


```hcl
resource "google_logging_project_settings" "example" {
  project                = "my-project-name"
  kms_service_account_id = data.google_logging_project_settings.settings.kms_service_account_id
}

data "google_logging_project_settings" "settings" {
  project = "my-project-name"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `project` -
  (Required)
  The project for which to retrieve settings.


- - -


* `kms_service_account_id` -
  (Optional)
  The service account that will be used by the Log Router to access your Cloud KMS key. This can be modified only once to migrate from the legacy CMEK service account to the logging service account as described in [Migrate CMEK SA](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/routing/troubleshoot-cmek-orgs#migrate-cmek-sa).

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/settings`

* `name` -
  The resource name of the settings.

* `kms_key_name` -
  The resource name for the configured Cloud KMS key.

* `storage_location` -
  The storage location that Cloud Logging will use to create new resources when a location is needed but not explicitly provided.

* `disable_default_sink` -
  If set to true, the _Default sink in newly created projects and folders will created in a disabled state. This can be used to automatically disable log storage if there is already an aggregated sink configured in the hierarchy. The _Default sink can be re-enabled manually if needed.

* `logging_service_account_id` -
  The service account for the given container. Sinks use this service account as their writerIdentity if no custom service account is provided.


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 20 minutes.

## Import


ProjectSettings can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/settings`
* `{{project}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import ProjectSettings using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/settings"
  to = google_logging_project_settings.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), ProjectSettings can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_logging_project_settings.default projects/{{project}}/settings
$ terraform import google_logging_project_settings.default {{project}}
```

## User Project Overrides

This resource supports [User Project Overrides](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/provider_reference#user_project_override).
