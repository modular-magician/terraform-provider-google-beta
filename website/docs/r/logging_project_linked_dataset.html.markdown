# google\_logging\_project\_linked\_dataset

Describes a BigQuery linked dataset



## Example Usage - Logging Project Linked Dataset


```hcl
resource "google_logging_project_bucket_config" "logging_project_linked_dataset" {
  location         = "global"
  project          = "my-project-name"
  enable_analytics = true
  bucket_id        = "tftest%{random_suffix}"
}

resource "google_logging_project_linked_dataset" "logging_project_linked_dataset" {
  link_id = "tftest%{random_suffix}"
  bucket  = google_logging_project_bucket_config.logging_project_linked_dataset.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `link_id` -
  (Required)
  The id of the linked dataset.

* `bucket` -
  (Required)
  The bucket for which the linked dataset will be created


- - -


* `description` -
  (Optional)
  Describes this link. The maximum length of the description is 8000 characters.

* `bigquery_dataset` -
  (Optional)
  The information of a BigQuery Dataset. When a link is created, a BigQuery dataset is created along
  with it, in the same project as the LogBucket it's linked to. This dataset will also have BigQuery
  Views corresponding to the LogViews in the bucket.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_bigquery_dataset).


<a name="nested_bigquery_dataset"></a>The `bigquery_dataset` block supports:

* `dataset_id` -
  (Output)
  Output only. The full resource name of the BigQuery dataset. The DATASET_ID will match the ID
  of the link, so the link must match the naming restrictions of BigQuery datasets
  (alphanumeric characters and underscores only). The dataset will have a resource path of
  "bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET_ID]"

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `{{bucket}}/links/{{link_id}}`

* `name` -
  The resource name of the linked dataset. The name can have up to 100 characters. A valid link id
  (at the end of the link name) must only have alphanumeric characters and underscores within it.

* `create_time` -
  Output only. The creation timestamp of the link. A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format,
  with nanosecond resolution and up to nine fractional digits. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z"
  and "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z".

* `lifecycle_state` -
  Output only. The resource lifecycle state.
