## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `feature_online_store` -
  (Required)
  The name of the FeatureOnlineStore to use, in the format projects/{project}/locations/{region}/featureOnlineStores/{featureOnlineStore}.


- - -


* `name` -
  (Optional)
  Name of the FeatureView. This value may be up to 60 characters, and valid characters are [a-z0-9_]. The first character cannot be a number.

* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  A set of key/value label pairs to assign to this FeatureView.

  **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration.
  Please refer to the field `effective_labels` for all of the labels present on the resource.

* `sync_config` -
  (Optional)
  Configures when data is to be synced/updated for this FeatureView. At the end of the sync the latest featureValues for each entityId of this FeatureView are made ready for online serving.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_sync_config).

* `big_query_source` -
  (Optional)
  Configures how data is supposed to be extracted from a BigQuery source to be loaded onto the FeatureOnlineStore.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_big_query_source).

* `feature_registry_source` -
  (Optional)
  Configures the features from a Feature Registry source that need to be loaded onto the FeatureOnlineStore.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_feature_registry_source).


<a name="nested_sync_config"></a>The `sync_config` block supports:

* `cron` -
  (Optional)
  Cron schedule (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) to launch scheduled runs.
  To explicitly set a timezone to the cron tab, apply a prefix in the cron tab: "CRON_TZ=${IANA_TIME_ZONE}" or "TZ=${IANA_TIME_ZONE}".

<a name="nested_big_query_source"></a>The `big_query_source` block supports:

* `uri` -
  (Required)
  The BigQuery view URI that will be materialized on each sync trigger based on FeatureView.SyncConfig.

* `entity_id_columns` -
  (Required)
  Columns to construct entityId / row keys. Start by supporting 1 only.

<a name="nested_feature_registry_source"></a>The `feature_registry_source` block supports:

* `feature_groups` -
  (Required)
  List of features that need to be synced to Online Store.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_feature_groups).


<a name="nested_feature_groups"></a>The `feature_groups` block supports:

* `feature_group_id` -
  (Required)
  Identifier of the feature group.

* `feature_ids` -
  (Required)
  Identifiers of features under the feature group.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `{{feature_online_store}}/featureViews/{{name}}`

* `etag` -
  Used to perform consistent read-modify-write updates.

* `create_time` -
  The timestamp of when the featureOnlinestore was created in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format, with nanosecond resolution and up to nine fractional digits.

* `update_time` -
  The timestamp of when the featureOnlinestore was last updated in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format, with nanosecond resolution and up to nine fractional digits.

* `terraform_labels` -
  The combination of labels configured directly on the resource
   and default labels configured on the provider.

* `effective_labels` -
  All of labels (key/value pairs) present on the resource in GCP, including the labels configured through Terraform, other clients and services.

## Import


FeatureOnlinestoreFeatureview can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `{{feature_online_store}}/featureViews/{{name}}`
* `{{feature_online_store}}/{{name}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import FeatureOnlinestoreFeatureview using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "{{feature_online_store}}/featureViews/{{name}}"
  to = google_vertex_ai_feature_onlinestore_featureview.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), FeatureOnlinestoreFeatureview can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_vertex_ai_feature_onlinestore_featureview.default {{feature_online_store}}/featureViews/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_vertex_ai_feature_onlinestore_featureview.default {{feature_online_store}}/{{name}}
```
