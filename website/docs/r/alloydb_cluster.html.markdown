# google\_alloydb\_cluster

A managed alloydb cluster.

~> **Warning:** This resource is in beta, and should be used with the terraform-provider-google-beta provider.
See [Provider Versions](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html) for more details on beta resources.

To get more information about Cluster, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/alloydb/docs/reference/rest/v1beta/projects.locations.clusters/create)
* How-to Guides
    * [AlloyDB](https://cloud.google.com/alloydb/docs/)

~> **Warning:** All arguments including `initial_user.password` will be stored in the raw
state as plain-text. [Read more about sensitive data in state](https://www.terraform.io/language/state/sensitive-data).

## Example Usage - Alloydb Cluster Basic


```hcl
resource "google_alloydb_cluster" "default" {
  provider   = google-beta
  cluster_id = "alloydb-cluster"
  location   = "us-central1"
  network    = "projects/${data.google_project.project.number}/global/networks/${google_compute_network.default.name}"

  initial_user {
    password = "alloydb-cluster"
  }
}

data "google_project" "project" {
  provider = google-beta
}

resource "google_compute_network" "default" {
  provider = google-beta
  name = "alloydb-cluster"
} 
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

  "projects/{projectNumber}/global/networks/{network_id}".

* `cluster_id` -
  (Required)
  The ID of the alloydb cluster.


- - -


* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  User-defined labels for the alloydb cluster.

* `annotations` -
  (Optional)
  Annotations to allow client tools to store small amount of arbitrary data. This is distinct from labels.

* `display_name` -
  (Optional)

* `location` -
  (Optional)
  The location where the alloydb cluster should reside.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

  The length of the time window during which a backup can be taken. If a backup does not succeed within this time window, it will be canceled and considered failed.
  The backup window must be at least 5 minutes long. There is no upper bound on the window. If not set, it will default to 1 hour.
  A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, terminated by 's'. Example: "3.5s".
