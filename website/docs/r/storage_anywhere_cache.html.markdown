# google_storage_anywhere_cache

The Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Anywhere Cache feature allows users to create SSD backed zonal read cache for their buckets. These zonal caches are co-located with the customers compute engines to provide cost efficiency.

  The name of the bucket.

* `zone` -
  (Required)
  The zone where cache needs to be created


- - -


* `admission_policy` -
  (Optional)
  The admission policy of cache

* `ttl` -
  (Optional)
  The time-to-live for cache


## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `b/{{bucket}}/anywhereCaches/{{anywhereCacheId}}`

* `anywhere_cache_id` -
  The id of the cache


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 60 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 60 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 20 minutes.

## Import


AnywhereCache can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `b/{{bucket}}/anywhereCaches/{{anywhereCacheId}}`
* `{{bucket}}/{{anywhereCacheId}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import AnywhereCache using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "b/{{bucket}}/anywhereCaches/{{anywhereCacheId}}"
  to = google_storage_anywhere_cache.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), AnywhereCache can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_storage_anywhere_cache.default b/{{bucket}}/anywhereCaches/{{anywhereCacheId}}
$ terraform import google_storage_anywhere_cache.default {{bucket}}/{{anywhereCacheId}}
```
