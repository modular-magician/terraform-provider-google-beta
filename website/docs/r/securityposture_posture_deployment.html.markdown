Represents a deployment of a security posture on a resource.



## Example Usage - Securityposture Posture Deployment Basic


```hcl
resource "google_securityposture_posture" "posture_basic" {
    posture_id          = "posture_basic"
    parent = "organizations/123456789/locations/global"
    state = "ACTIVE"
    description = "a new posture"
    policy_sets {
        policy_set_id = "org_policy_set"
        description = "set of org policies"
        policies {
            policy_id = "policy_1"
            constraint {
                org_policy_constraint {
                    canned_constraint_id = "storage.publicAccessPrevention"
                    policy_rules {
                        enforce = true
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

resource "google_securityposture_posture_deployment" "postureDeployment" {
	posture_deployment_id          = "posture_deployment_1"
	parent = "organizations/123456789/locations/global"
    description = "a new posture deployment"
    target_resource = "projects/"
    posture_id = google_securityposture_posture.posture_basic.name
    posture_revision_id = google_securityposture_posture.posture_basic.revision_id
}
```

  It denotes the desired Posture to be deployed.

* `desired_posture_revision_id` -

## Import


PostureDeployment can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `{{parent}}/postureDeployments/{{posture_deployment_id}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import PostureDeployment using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "{{parent}}/postureDeployments/{{posture_deployment_id}}"
  to = google_securityposture_posture_deployment.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), PostureDeployment can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_securityposture_posture_deployment.default {{parent}}/postureDeployments/{{posture_deployment_id}}
```
